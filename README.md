# Netflix-Clone
This is a responsive front-end clone of the Netflix login page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design closely follows the original Netflix login screen, featuring a modern layout with clean styling.

Key features include:

Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens

Basic email validation using JavaScript

Smooth styling with CSS Flexbox and media queries

This project was created as a learning exercise to practice front-end web development skills and understand real-world UI design implementation.
